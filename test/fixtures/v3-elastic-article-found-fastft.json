He was said to have had a good relationship with Wolfgang Reitzle, the current chairman and long-time chief executive from 2003 to 2014, but their relationship deteriorated when he was passed over as a successor in 2014.</p><p>The job instead went to Wolfgang Büchele, who at the time was head of Kemira Oyj, a Finnish chemicals group. Linde has issued two profit warnings since Mr Büchele took over and the idea to join forces with Praxair was originally his, people familiar said.</p><p>One person familiar with the deal contests that Mr Denoke was against the merger for personal reasons. “He’d be a bad CFO if he didn’t scrutinise everything,” this person said, adding that the labour side of the supervisory board was also upset that a merged Praxair-Linde would be headquartered in Danbury, Conn.</p><p>Sven Schneider, head of treasury at Linde, is to be interim CFO.</p>",

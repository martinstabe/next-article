				"bodyXML": "<p>The equilibrium real rate of interest, or R* in the jargon of macro economists, has moved into the centre of the debate about monetary policy in the US. Macro investors have become very familiar with the concept over the past couple of years, because it is clear that it is driving the Federal Reserve’s attitude towards the normalisation of US monetary policy.</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/gavyndavies/files/2016/09/ftblog1130.png\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"368\" src=\"http://blogs.ft.com/gavyndavies/files/2016/09/ftblog1130.png\" width=\"403\"/></a>Recently, the frequent mention of the concept in the minutes of the FOMC has forced it into the minds of a much wider field of investors, who do not need reminding that the Fed is still the key player driving global asset prices in the medium term. Anything that matters to the Fed matters to all investors.</p><p>But many people are still confused by R*. This blog is intended to clarify the somewhat obscure, but critically important, concept of R*. It is written in a Q&amp;A format.</p><p><strong>What on earth is R*?</strong></p><p>Conceptually, it is a fairly straightforward idea. R* is the real short term interest rate that would pertain when the economy is at equilibrium, meaning that unemployment is at the natural rate and inflation is at the 2 per cent target. This might be described as the rate the Fed should adopt under “normal” conditions, though it might take a while to get there. When interest rates are below R*, monetary policy is expansionary and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Why is this particularly relevant now?</strong></p><p>Because the economy is now very close to “normal”. For many years, monetary policy has been driven mainly by excess unemployment and below target inflation. Neither is so obvious now. The economy is back to normal, so monetary policy needs to return to a normal setting.</p><p><strong>So that means the Fed should set the real short rate at the “normal” level, meaning the average seen in recent decades?</strong></p><p>No, because R* may have changed. What has been normal in the past may not be normal in the future. For decades, no one focused on R* because it was viewed as one of the great constants of the economy. The Fed and everyone else accepted that “normalisation” implied a return to the long run average for real short term rates. That would imply that the Fed funds rate should return to a level of about 4 per cent – 2 per cent real, and 2 per cent for inflation. If that reasoning still applied, it would require an awful lot of monetary tightening from here.<br/></p><p><strong>But the Fed has never suggested that anything like that is around the corner, has it?</strong></p><p>No. But this time last year, when the FOMC wanted to prepare the markets for the normalisation of monetary policy, they suggested that the Fed funds rate would rise from almost zero to a long run equilibrium level of 3.4 per cent by the end of 2018. At that time, they seemed very confident that rates should return to “normal” over 3 years and also that they knew, with reasonable certainty, what that long run equilibrium rate would be. They said that R* was temporarily below normal because of economic headwinds, which would abate in the next few years. These headwinds included fiscal tightening, restricted availability of bank credit and weak foreign economies. As the headwinds dwindled, interest rates would have to rise.</p><p><strong>Have they changed their minds on this?</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/gavyndavies/files/2016/09/ftblog1132.png\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://blogs.ft.com/gavyndavies/files/2016/09/ftblog1132.png\" width=\"400\"/></a>Yes. The projections they published for R* a year ago have now fallen markedly. Their latest estimate for the equilibrium rate at the end of 2018 is only 2.4 per cent nominal and 0.4 per cent real. That is a change of about 100 basis points in a year. What is more, they are now far less confident that they know the correct level of R* with any certainty. Janet Yellen <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20160826a.htm\">published</a> a graph last month suggesting that the 70 per cent confidence band around their projected Fed funds rate in two years time is about 500 basis points. Most of this wide band appears to stem from uncertainty about the true level of R*.</p><p><strong>What caused this large revision in the FOMC’s estimate of R*? Did the headwinds get worse?</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/gavyndavies/files/2016/09/ftblog1131.png\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"270\" src=\"http://blogs.ft.com/gavyndavies/files/2016/09/ftblog1131.png\" width=\"400\"/></a>Not really. In fact, they no longer talk very much about temporary headwinds at all. Instead, they now think that R* may never return to levels that would have been considered normal a few years ago. The most <a href=\"http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/wp2016-11.pdf\">influential work</a> on R* inside the Fed has been done by John Williams, President of the San Francisco Fed, and two colleagues. Their estimate of R* is driven mainly by the rate of growth in trend GDP, which is not expected to rebound soon.</p><p>In their work, there still seems to be some role for other factors to drive R* downwards, because the R* estimate (0.4 per cent real or 2.4 per cent nominal) is about 100 basis points below the trend growth rate. But these factors are not described as temporary. Not only is the decline in R* now viewed as “highly persistent”, it is due in part to global factors that operate well beyond the shores of the US. This international dimension was not widely recognised inside the Fed a year ago <em>[1]</em>.</p><p><strong>Does this mean that the Fed now thinks that monetary policy will never return fully to normal, even in the long run?</strong></p><p>Hard to say. Williams et al say specifically that there is no sign that R* is beginning to rise. If the trend rate of growth of productivity bounces back from its present very depressed level, then R* might rise, and the amount of tightening needed by the Fed would also increase. But the Fed is no longer drawing any attention to this risk.</p><p><strong> What does the market think of all this?</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/gavyndavies/files/2016/09/ftblog1134.png\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"380\" src=\"http://blogs.ft.com/gavyndavies/files/2016/09/ftblog1134.png\" width=\"400\"/></a>The bond market has never really believed that the FOMC would raise rates on the hawkish path implied by the Fed’s high R* estimate made a year ago. Even now that the Fed’s R* estimate has declined, the market is still extremely sceptical that rates will rise in the way that the Fed suggests.</p><p><strong>Does that mean that there is a risk that the market will one day be shocked by a sharp rise in US rate towards R*?</strong></p><p>Of course that is a possibility. Since we are very uncertain about the level of R* now and in the future, it is certainly conceivable that R* is higher than anyone thinks. If so, then monetary policy is much more expansionary than the Fed or the market believes, and inflation might suddenly rise. That would imply a much more hawkish Fed as they recognise that they must both suppress inflation and adjust to a much higher R* than they currently expect. This would be a nightmare for markets <em>[2]</em>.</p><p><strong>So did the bout of market turbulence on Friday reflect a rising risk that this nightmare will happen?</strong></p><p>Not really. If the FOMC raises rates by 25 basis points at the FOMC meeting on 21 September, this could well be against the background of another drop in their estimate of R*. It would be a “dovish hike” – quite unlike the “hawkish hike” that unhinged global financial markets last December. The rise in bond yields on Friday seems to be driven mainly by the perception that QE is fading in Japan and the Eurozone, not by the risk of a very hostile Fed.</p><p>——————————————————————————————————-</p><p><em>Footnotes</em></p><p><em>[1] The best recent explanation of why the FOMC no longer believes that the headwinds will abate is from Bill Dudley <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2016/dud160731a\">here</a>.</em></p><p><em>[2] A different view of the headwinds, and why he thinks they may fade, is provided by Olivier Blanchard <a href=\"https://piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/three-remarks-us-treasury-yield-curve\">here</a>.</em></p>",
